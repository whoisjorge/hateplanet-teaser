This repository contains the source code of the very first website-teaser made for the artistic collective [Hate Planet]. Developed with **Vue.js** in the Front-end and **Webpack** as a module bundler/build optimizer. It also implements a very straightforward database service that stores emails with the **Firebase Realtime Database** as well as deployments are managed using **Firebase Hosting**, which serves a Single Page Application through HTTPS.
